Hello I'm Taylor. I'm 17 and have some experience fucking around with code. I started my programming journey working with with Arduinos which was a great place to start. Now I've written a script or two in VBA as well as my music downloader script which is written in python. My main focus is on embeded development and although my repos don't show it yet I have a bit of knowledge in that field.
